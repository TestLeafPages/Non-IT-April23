Recap

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.
It defines the properties and behaviors that an object of 
that class should have.

A class consists of variables, methods.

An object is an instance of a class

An object is created using the "new" keyword

When a new instance of a class is created using the new keyword,
memory is allocated for that object and
the class's constructor is called to initialize the object.

Once an object is created, you can access its properties 
and methods using dot notation.

The variables in a class ->data of an object. 

Methods define the behavior of the object.

access return methodName(input arg){
}

Data types are used to specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable,
as well as the operations that can be performed on that data.
Java has two categories of data types: 
primitive data types and Non-primitive data types.

Primitive data types 

boolean: represents true/false values
byte: represents a small integer value 8
short: represents a short integer value 16
int: represents an integer value 32
long: represents a long integer value 64l
float: represents a  floating-point value 32 f
double: represents a  floating-point value 64 d
char: represents a single character value'T'

Non-primitive

String: represents a sequence of characters
Arrays: represents a collection of elements of the same type
Classes: represents objects with properties and behaviors
Operators:
operators are special symbols that perform specific operations
 
1.Arithmetic operators:
These operators are used to perform mathematical operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,and division.
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)-Que
% (modulus or remainder)

2.Assignment operators:
These operators are used to assign values to variables. 
= (assignment)
+= (add and assign)
-= (subtract and assign)
*= (multiply and assign)
/= (divide and assign)
%= (modulus and assign)

3.Comparison operators:
These operators are used to compare two value
and return a boolean value (true or false). 
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)

4.Logical operators:
These operators are used to combine two or more boolean expressions
and return a boolean value.
&& (logical and) 
AND----->&&
1*0=0     T F F
0*1=0     F T F
0*0=0     F F F
1*1=1     T T T

(5==5)&&(5<5)---false

|| (logical or)
addition
OR------>||
1+0=1    T F T
0+1=1    F T T
1+1=1    T T T
0+0=0    F F F
(5==5)||(5<5)---True
! (logical not or negation)
1---0   T F

0---1   F  T
boolean flag=false;
!flag
5. unary operator
Increment operator (++) 
Decrement operator (--)


For Loop:
---------
fixed number of time 

syntax:
--------
for(initialization;condition;incre/decre){
//body of the statement
}
for(int i=0;i<=5;i++){
syso(i)
}

While
------
while(condition){
}

example:
536
sum of the number
 int num=536;
 split one by one 
 %
 
factorial of 5
 ---------------
 1.decalre and intialization
num=5
5*4*3*2*1=120
int num=5;--->Declare
int fact=24;
for()
fact=fact*i;//1*1=1

1*2=2
2*3=6
6*4=24
24*5=120;
 
 
 if(condtion){
 syso()
 }
 if(mark>35){
 }
 if(){
 }
 else{
 }
 if(){
 else if(){
 }
 }
 
switch(Mon){
 case:1
 sys("Mon");
 break;
 case:2
 sys("Tue");
 break;
 case:3
 sys("wed");
 break;
 }
 chrome edge firefox safari
cross browser testing

Switch(condtion)

case 1:
syso("chrome");
break;
case2:
syso("edge")
break;

default
syso("no browser")



The return statement can be used in two ways:
----------------------------------------------

Returning a value: When a method has a return type
(other than void), the return statement is used to return a value of that type. 



Exiting a method: When a method does not have a return type (i.e., it returns void), the return statement is used to exit the method.
public void printNumbers(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
        if (i == 5) {
            return;
        }
    }
}
